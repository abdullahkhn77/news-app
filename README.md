# News App Project
The application connects to the internet and fetches news from the New York Times API using HttpURLConnection, which is then 
parsed using a custom built JSON parser. The parsed information is then presented as a news feed in namely four categories - 
Tech, Science, Travel, and Books. The splash screen presents these categories with a help of a tabbed layout and viewpager, 
thereby doing away with additional screens and making it easier for the user to access any news category with just a finger 
swipe. 

This app has been built to the specifications of the News app project rubric, which is part of the 
Networking module of [Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803).

### Objective
